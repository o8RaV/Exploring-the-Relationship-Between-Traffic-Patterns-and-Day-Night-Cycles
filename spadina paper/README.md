# LLM-Usage

In conducting this research, it is important to note that no Large Language Models (LLMs) were utilized. The analysis and findings presented in this paper were generated without the assistance of LLMs or any auto-complete tools such as co-pilot. The research process relied solely on conventional data analysis techniques and methodologies. By excluding the use of LLMs, we aimed to ensure transparency and reproducibility in our research methodology.

# Exploring Mate Competition As A Driver OF Anti Refugee Hate Crime

## Abstract

This study delves into the nuanced dynamics of hate crimes against refugees, particularly focusing on the often overlooked aspect of mate competition among native men. Drawing from comprehensive data in Germany, the research indicates a correlation between hate crime incidence and imbalances in the local mating market. The findings suggest that individual-level support for hate crimes increases when men perceive an inflow of refugees as a threat to their access to female partners. Even after accounting for factors like job competition, anti-refugee sentiments, and general frustration, concerns about mate competition persist. The study underscores the importance of considering marriage markets in understanding hate crimes and immigrant conflict and calls for further inquiry in similar environments to draw conclusive generalizations. It also emphasizes the urgent need for policy and practice to address racism and hate crimes.
