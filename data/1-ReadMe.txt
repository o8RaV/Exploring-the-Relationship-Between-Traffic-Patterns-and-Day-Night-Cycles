**Journal:** Journal of Urban Data Science  
**Author:** Raghav Kanda  

**Operating Environment:**
- **Operating System:** Windows 11 Home
- **Device:** ASUS TUF Dash F15
- **Processor:** 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-12450H   2.00 GHz
- **Memory:** 16.0 GB (15.6 GB usable) DDR4
- **Software:** R version 4.0.2

**LLM Usage:**

This research was conducted without the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) or any auto-complete tools such as co-pilot. The analysis and findings presented in this paper were generated solely through conventional data analysis techniques and methodologies.

**R Packages Used:**

Base R functions: Utilized for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.

**Description:**

This documentation provides a detailed outline of the replication process for the logistic regression analysis presented in "Exploring the Relationship Between Traffic Patterns and Day-Night Cycles: A Logistic Regression Analysis" published in the Journal of Urban Data Science. The replication process involves the usage of R scripts and synthetic datasets generated within the code.

**Files Used:**
- **None:** The synthetic data is generated programmatically within the R script.

**Analysis Components:**
- **Model:** Logistic regression model to explore the relationship between traffic patterns and day-night cycles.
- **Results:** Summary statistics, coefficient estimates, and visualizations.

**Procedure:**

1. **Code Execution:**
   - Execute the provided R script to run the logistic regression analysis.

2. **Model Construction:**
   - Synthetic data is generated within the script to simulate traffic patterns and day-night cycles.
   - A logistic regression model is built to predict the likelihood of it being daytime based on the number of cars observed.

3. **Analysis Output:**
   - Summary statistics and coefficient estimates from the logistic regression model.
   - Visualizations depicting the relationship between traffic density and the probability of daytime.

**Output Files:**
- The output will consist of summary statistics, coefficient estimates, and visualizations generated within the R script.
