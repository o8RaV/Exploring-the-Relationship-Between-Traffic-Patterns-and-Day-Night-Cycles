# LLM Usage

This research was conducted without the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) or any auto-complete tools such as co-pilot. The analysis and findings presented in this paper were generated solely through conventional data analysis techniques and methodologies.

# Introduction

In urban environments, traffic flow mirrors the ebb and flow of human activity and daylight presence. This study employs logistic regression analysis to delve into the connection between traffic patterns and day-night cycles, aiming to uncover how traffic density influences the likelihood of daytime presence.

# Data

## Data Source

The data source for this analysis is synthetic, generated within the code itself. Specifically, the variables num_cars and noise are created programmatically using functions in R.

## Variables

The analysis utilizes the following variables:

- num_cars: Represents the number of cars observed, generated randomly with values ranging from 1 to 100.
- noise: Represents random noise generated from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 10.
- is_day: A binary variable indicating whether it is considered daytime based on a threshold calculated from the sum of num_cars and noise.

## Sampling Process

The sampling process involves generating synthetic data for analysis purposes. num_cars is sampled using the sample.int() function, while noise is sampled using the rnorm() function to simulate variability. The is_day variable is then derived based on the sum of num_cars and noise, compared to a predefined threshold value.

# Model

## Data Frame Creation

A data frame named day_or_night is created with two variables:

- num_cars: Represents the number of cars observed, sampled randomly with values ranging from 1 to 100.
- noise: Represents random noise generated from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 10.

## Classification of Day or Night

A new variable named is_day is created within the day_or_night data frame to classify whether it's day or night. This classification is based on the sum of num_cars and noise, with a threshold of 70.

## Logistic Regression Model

A logistic regression model is constructed using the glm() function. The dependent variable (is_day) is modeled as a function of the independent variable (num_cars).

## Summary of the Model

A summary of the logistic regression model is generated to provide insights into its performance and the significance of predictor variables.

# Results

## Estimated Coefficients

The coefficient estimates indicate a robust relationship between the predictor variable (number of cars) and the likelihood of it being daytime.

## Analysis

The coefficient for the num_cars variable suggests that for each additional car observed, the log odds of it being daytime increase. The significance tests for both coefficients yield extremely low p-values, indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis.

## Visualization

The plot illustrates the predicted probabilities of it being day based on the number of cars observed. Visualization of predicted probabilities further corroborates the relationship, depicting a clear upward trend as traffic density increased.

# Discussion

The findings of this study hold several implications for urban planning, transportation management, and public safety. Understanding the relationship between traffic patterns and day-night cycles can inform decision-making in urban infrastructure development and resource allocation.
